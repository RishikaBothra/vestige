# Aadhaar Activity Mix (State-Level)

This analysis compares new Aadhaar enrolments with updates at the state level.

## What was measured

For each state:

- New enrolments
- Demographic updates (name, address, etc.)
- Biometric updates (fingerprints, iris scans)

The update-to-enrolment ratio was calculated as:
```math
\text{update-to-enrolment ratio} =
\frac{\text{demographic} + \text{biometric updates}}{\text{enrolments}}
```

This ratio provides a rough indicator of system activity patterns.

## Key findings

Updates massively outnumber new enrolments across all states. The ratio ranges from about 2.5× to 9×.

This pattern holds for both populous states (UP, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu) and smaller ones. The highest ratios appear in places with fewer new enrolments, not because updates are unusually high, but because the enrolment baseline is low.

Aadhaar activity is overwhelmingly driven by updates, not new sign-ups.

## Caveat on the ratio

This number shouldn't be interpreted as a precise metric.

Enrolments and updates serve different purposes. A single person can update multiple times. The data doesn't distinguish mandatory from voluntary updates. Population saturation and timeframe effects aren't normalized.

Still, the pattern is clear and consistent across states.

## Implications

Aadhaar operates as a mature, maintenance-heavy system. System load, cost, and operational complexity are driven primarily by updates. Enrolment counts alone significantly underrepresent actual activity.

## Summary

Aadhaar functions primarily as a maintenance system. Updates consistently outnumber new enrolments by a wide margin across every state.
